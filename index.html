<!-- intro section -->
                <h2><mark>This is my introduction section</mark></h2>
                <p> My name is <b>Demarick Webb</b> and I am a computer science student. I am in my <i> senior </i>year at Middle Tennessee State University. After Completing High School I  joined the United states army. I served in the Army as an information technology specialist. While I was in the Army I learned many valuable skills that have helped me in my studies and career. I lived in a couple fun places such as Daegu, South Korea and Colorado Springs, Colorado.. After my time in the Army I spent about 2 years travelling and spending time with family before starting my journey at Nashville State community College to study computer science. I got my associates degree in 2024 and transferred to MTSU to finish my bachelors degree and one day work for a company or the government as a cybersecurity analyst or engineer. In my free time I enjoy playing video games, watching sports, and spending time with friends and family. </p>
